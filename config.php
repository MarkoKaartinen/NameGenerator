<?php
/*
Syntax for the language files is:
"folder name in names folder" => "Name of the languege"
So example:

$langs = array(
	"fi" => "Suomi",
	"en" => "English"
);

fi folder is Suomi (finnish) and en folder is English
In this version I have only finnish file so $langs array has only finnish folder
*/

$langs = array(
	"fi" => "Suomi"
);
